Education gives females a pathway from poverty, providing opportunity to succeed in work and in family care and management.  Too many women have never had the opportunity to reach their full potential and therefore contribute fully to society.",
        "longTermImpact": "AIL is trusted and highly respected  so conservative villages trust its staff to come into their communities and  provide services. Thousands of isolated, under-served and desperate women, with few options to improve their lives, are provided with services.  Raising up women and girls through education, healthcare, training in leadership and human rights, is the way to close the gap in gender equality and to allow women to reach their potential and contribute to community and nation.",
        "activities": "AIL's centers  provide women and children  with education such as literacy, math, tailoring, computer and English skills. These women go on to start home sewing businesses or get jobs. Quality health care provided by AIL clinics mean women are healthy and understand how to take care of themselves and their children. Healthy families can work, study and prosper. Educated women want their daughters educated. Girls are raised up in society and the gap in gender equality is closed.",
